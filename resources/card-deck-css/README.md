How to use our card styles:
- Cardstarter.css has a bunch of classes such as ".card.h09" (9 of hearts) and ".card.sA" (ace of spades) and ".card-back-blue" (back of card - blue deck) and ".card-back-red"
- These classes correspond to images in the images/ folder
- there are also styles for rotating cards - read the cardstarter.css comments

So yeah, you can have beautiful looking cards by just adding a class to something.
